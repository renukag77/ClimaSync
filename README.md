# ClimaSync 🌤️

ClimaSync is a weather forecasting and analysis web application that provides real-time and future weather predictions based on historical data. It leverages machine learning models to predict weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, rainfall, and pressure for the next 5 days. Additionally, the app allows users to sort and filter weather data using different algorithms like Merge Sort and Quick Sort.

This project combines **Python (FastAPI)** for the backend, **React** for the frontend, and **Machine Learning** techniques to predict future weather patterns, making it a comprehensive solution for analyzing and visualizing weather data.

## Features 🎯

- **Weather Forecasting**: Predicts weather parameters (Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, etc.) for the next 5 days.
- **Data Sorting**: Use algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort) to sort weather data for better insights.
- **Weather Trend Analysis**: Visualizes weather trends over time with interactive charts.
- **City-based Data**: Supports weather data for multiple cities (e.g., Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore).
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Provides a user-friendly interface to interact with data, view trends, and check forecasts.
- **Data Filtering**: Filter weather data for specific cities and parameters.
